# Medical Insurance Data Analysis – Smoker Detection  

This project analyzes a **Medical Insurance dataset** to study the factors that influence insurance charges and to identify patterns related to whether a person is a smoker or not.  
The focus is on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover meaningful insights and prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency  
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., smoker, region, gender)  
- Detecting and treating outliers in insurance charges  
- Feature scaling and normalization of numerical attributes  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical summaries of charges, age, BMI, and smoker status  
- Correlation analysis to see how smoking impacts medical charges  
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:  
  - Boxplots showing charge differences between smokers and non-smokers  
  - Histograms for age, BMI, and charges distribution  
  - Countplots of smoker vs. non-smoker groups  
- Interactive visualizations with **Plotly** for deeper insights  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → data visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn (preprocessing)** → encoding and scaling utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → step-by-step analysis and documentation
