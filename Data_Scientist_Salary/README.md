# Data Scientist Salaries Data Analysis  

This project analyzes a **Data Scientist Salaries dataset** to explore salary distributions, job roles, experience levels, and geographic patterns.  
The focus is on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights into compensation trends in the data science field.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and ensuring dataset consistency  
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., job title, company size, experience level)  
- Detecting and treating outliers in salary data  
- Normalizing and scaling numerical features when needed  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Salary distribution across roles, experience levels, and regions  
- Correlation analysis between salary, job type, and company attributes  
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:  
  - Boxplots of salary by job title and seniority  
  - Histograms of salary ranges and experience levels  
  - Heatmaps to highlight relationships between variables  
- Interactive plots with **Plotly** for deeper exploration  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → data visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn (preprocessing)** → encoding and scaling utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → step-by-step analysis and documentation
