# Titanic Data Analysis  

This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to analyze passenger demographics, travel classes, and survival patterns.  
The goal is to apply **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover meaningful insights about the factors that influenced survival.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values in age, cabin, and embarked columns  
- Detecting and managing outliers in age and fare  
- Encoding categorical features (sex, embarked, class)  
- Feature scaling for numerical variables when needed  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical summaries of passenger demographics and survival rates  
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:  
  - Survival distribution by gender and passenger class  
  - Age and fare distributions for survivors vs. non-survivors  
  - Correlation heatmap of survival with other features  
- Interactive charts with **Plotly** for deeper insights  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn (preprocessing)** → encoding and scaling utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → step-by-step analysis and documentation
