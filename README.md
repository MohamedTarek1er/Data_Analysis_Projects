# Data Analysis Projects  

This repository contains a collection of **Data Analysis projects** completed during different courses and self-practice.  
Each project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and visualizing datasets using a wide range of tools and libraries to extract meaningful insights and prepare data for further use.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values with imputation techniques  
- Detecting and treating outliers  
- Removing and managing duplicate records  
- Encoding categorical data  
- Feature scaling and normalization  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization  
- Statistical analysis and correlation studies  
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Interactive dashboards and plots using **Plotly**  
- Identifying patterns, distributions, and anomalies  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data handling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn (preprocessing)** → encoding and scaling utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → project development and documentation
