# House Pricing Data Analysis  

This project focuses on analyzing a **House Pricing dataset** to uncover patterns, relationships, and factors that influence property prices.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, with the goal of preparing the dataset for machine learning tasks.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values in numerical and categorical features  
- Detecting and treating outliers in pricing and size-related attributes  
- Removing duplicates and ensuring data consistency  
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., location, building type)  
- Feature scaling and normalization for numeric attributes  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical summaries and distribution analysis of house prices  
- Correlation heatmaps to identify key factors affecting price  
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for:  
  - Price distribution across neighborhoods  
  - Relationship between area/rooms and pricing  
  - Outlier visualization using boxplots  
- Interactive plots and dashboards with **Plotly** for deeper insights  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn (preprocessing)** → encoding and scaling utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → step-by-step analysis and documentation
